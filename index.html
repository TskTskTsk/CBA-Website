    <h2> Customer Testomonials </h2>
      <h4> Jayne: </h4>
      <p> "Thank you so much for everything you did over the past months to make Emily’s and Ben’s wedding weekend so wonderful. Even now, several weeks after the event, our friends continue to talk about the food and how terrific your staff was throughout the weekend and during Sheva Brachot after the wedding. With your guidance, we came up with a weekend plan which worked well for everyone and a delicious and memorable wedding menu.

      As always, we appreciate the care you and your staff took to consider the myriad of dietary needs our family members have while planning and executing all the meals. It is so nice to know we can reach out to you without hesitation to arrange for food that is delicious, beautifully presented, and safe for us to eat."</p>

      <h4> Michelle & Stephen: </h4>
      <p> "You are an absolute delight to work with. Your easy-going manner, combined with a desire to give us everything we wanted, while making sure every detail from every vendor fit together like a puzzle and led to a fantastic simcha for us! You very generously and graciously handled the last-minute changes. Everything you touched was spot-on. Every recommendation, from food to vendor suggestions, contributed to what I would very deliberately call a perfect day, and I do not use that word frivolously. And the fact that you were physically present at the wedding made me feel beyond secure in knowing that I had not one worry and could just enjoy myself, enjoy my son’s wedding, enjoy my guests, the food, the dancing, everything! Your staff was delightful and accommodating, adding to the enjoyment of our guests." </p>
      <h4> Jeremy, Rebecca, David & Aviva: </h4>
      <p> "Thank you so much for your expert facilitation of the catered events for Joel and Maya's wedding! From the time we met with you in December until the wedding, you helped us immensely with every step. Every request we made was met with "of course." And every question was met with a quick response. You made us feel as though we were the only clients with whom you were working. The weekend's events were great. Everything was well organized, and the staff was extremely friendly. Thank you, too, for patiently guiding us to excellent food choices. You helped make a special weekend memorable!" </p>

    <h2> Kashrut </h2>
      <p> Catering By Andrew is under the supervision of the KVH (KVH Kosher – Rabbinical Council of New England) with a Mashgiach Tamidi on premises at all time. [Symbol will be posted tomorrow] We run a Glatt kosher, Shomer Shabbos kitchen and only use Chassidishe Scheita meats. Cholov Yisroel is available upon request.
